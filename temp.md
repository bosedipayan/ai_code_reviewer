❌ Bad Code:

```javascript
function() { return a + b;}
```

🔍 Issues:

- ❌ Missing function name, making it an anonymous function without context or purpose.
- ❌ Implicitly relies on variables `a` and `b` being defined in the scope where the function is used, which makes it
  harder to understand and debug.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

- ✔️ Assigns a descriptive name (`add`) to the function, improving readability and reusability.
- ✔️ Declares `a` and `b` as parameters, explicitly stating the function's dependencies and making it more versatile.
- ✔️ No error handling if the input is not a number.

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  if (typeof a !== "number" || typeof b !== "number") {
    throw new Error("Both arguments must be numbers.");
  }
  return a + b;
}
```
